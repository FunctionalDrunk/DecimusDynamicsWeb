              3081 Planet Earth is a barren wasteland uninhabitable for humans.

            <p>
              The Zeons are a race of extraterrestrials who invaded Earth wiping out
              the planet’s people using chemical weapons and lethal gasses. Although
              these toxic substances destroyed the human population, another group
              of Earth’s inhabitants endured a much different fate. Wild raccoons
              experienced an improvement in mental capabilities, surpassing any
              potential that humans were able to reach.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              As the raccoons become more intelligent, they have gone underground
              to establish their own form of civilization. They built pilotable
              robots to assist them inm digging and lifting objects too heavy for
              their little bodies. The incredible innovations would come with a
              hefty price as tensions within the raccoon civilization have grown
              over the years.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              The Racoons split into four different factions, each with their own
              ulterior motives. Leaders from each faction would rise up to the
              occasion, and give direction to their respective contingents.
