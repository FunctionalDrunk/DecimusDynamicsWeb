            Permanently underground, the Raccoons are seeing their resources diminish year by year. 
            In order to upgrade and power their Decies, $DEDS are essential and without their Deci, 
            Raccoons stand no chance against earthâ€™s threats. So by the year 3081, all Factions 
            need to go out on expeditions to the Surface to collect $DEDS.
            <br><br>
            Nearly a century after 
            the War, the desolate and war-torn surface of Earth is finally flourishing and ready 
            for exploration and discovery. An abundance of $DEDS is waiting to be recovered by 
            specialized Raccoon expeditions.
