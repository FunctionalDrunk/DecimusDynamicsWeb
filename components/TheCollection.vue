                    They were determined to understand and improve Raccoon technology, based on the Zeon’s
                    advantages and the former human thirst for knowledge. The Strazar felt this combination could

                    The Bellicose favor power and brute force and believe they are the rightful Raccoon leaders, due to their exceptional tactical
